# Ferris 0.1 - Compact

As minimalist as the Ferris 0.1 - base, but featuring choc spacing instead of MX spacing,
resulting in an even smaller keyboard.

The keycaps availability for choc with choc spacing is less than that of choc switches
with MX spacing, so be sure to pay attention to the switches you are getting.

The MBK switches (pictured) are recommended as they are widely regarded as the best choc
switches for choc spaced boards.
