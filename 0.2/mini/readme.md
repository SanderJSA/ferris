# Ferris 0.2 - Mini

The Ferris 0.2 mini is the tiniest Ferris in all dimensions:
* It uses choc mini switches, like the Ferris 0.1 Low to reduce the keyboard's depth.
* It uses choc spacing between keys, like the Ferris 0.1 and 0.2 compact.
* It has no extra feature needing extra space.

Reminder that like for the Ferris 0.1 low, this keyboard uses uncommon and less readily
available "choc mini" switches that can be acquired from Kailh's store on AliExpress:
